# check_privacy.sh this script is NOT copied into the repos it inspects, so there is no
# second copy to drift, and therefore no version to carry here. It used to say 0.1.0 while
# the plugin shipped 0.2.2: a number nothing synchronises is a number that lies, and the
# version that means something is the plugin's, in .claude-plugin/plugin.json.

#
#   --require "A,B"   the required sections, instead of deducing them
#   --status  "a,b"   the admitted status vocabulary, instead of only checking drift
#   --portable        also run the portability checks (see PORTABLE below)
#
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 violations found, 2 usage error or nothing to check.
#
# Every violation line starts with a stable CODE, so a caller (and the bench) can tell
# which check fired. Eight different checks exit 1, and an exit code alone cannot say which:
#
#   NAME       filename does not follow the collection's own scheme
#   SECTION    a section that most records carry is missing from this one
#   STATUS     a record with no status, in a collection whose other records have one
#   DRIFT      two records spell the same status differently (Accepted vs accepted)
#   SUPERSEDE  a supersede reference resolves to nothing, or names no replacement
#   DUPLICATE  two records claim the same identifier
#   INDEX      the index and the directory disagree, in either direction
#   PORTABLE   content that breaks when the record is copied to another repo
#
# WHY DEDUCE. The linters in the field (mdbook-lint's ADR rules, madr-lint, adrkit) all
# validate against a published spec: Nygard, or MADR v2/v3/v4, chosen by auto-detection
# between those. A collection whose house convention is neither -- a date-prefixed filename
# with a bespoke section set -- gets its own convention reported as violations by every one
# of them. This script asks the collection what it does, and holds it to that.
#
# WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It never rewrites a record and never creates one. Writing is the

# negatives -- the worse direction for a guard. So the word must be the whole name or a
